Geopolymers are typically made from alkaline solutions and silicates, which react to form polysilicate compounds. These polysilicate compounds can be cross-linked with metal oxides such as aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide. This paper will discuss the mechanical properties of geopolymers and how they compare to traditional concrete.\\n\\nMechanical Properties of Geopolymers\\n\\nThe mechanical properties of geopolymers vary depending on their composition and relative proportions of the different materials used in their production. The properties also depend on what other materials are used in conjunction with them in the production process, such as reinforcing fibers or polymer matrices for example. For this reason it is difficult to generalize about the mechanical properties of geopolymers because there are so many variables involved in their production and application. However, some generalizations can be made about the strength and durability of these materials when compared with traditional concrete. \\nIn general, geopolymer concrete is more durable than traditional concrete because it has a higher resistance to abrasion due to its increased porosity. It also has a higher compressive strength than traditional concrete because its high alkalinity allows for cation exchange reactions between calcium ions in the Portland cement matrix and aluminum ions in the geopolymer material that form insoluble calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH\"\n",

Sodium hydroxide will produce strong but brittle geopolymers while potassium hydroxide will produce weak but flexible geopolymers. The physical properties also depend on the mineral content in the geopolymer mixture. For example, if there is more silica present in the mixture then it will have higher compressive strength than if there is less silica present.\\n\\nGeopolymer\\u2019s mechanical properties can be improved by adding organic polymeric binders to it, such as polyvinyl acetate or polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). This is because these polymeric binders increase the toughness and strength of the material. One disadvantage to this method is that it increases the cost of production since these polymeric binders are expensive.\\\"\"\n",

Geopolymers have higher compressive strength than traditional concretes but lower tensile strength, meaning they are more resistant to crushing than to stretching. This makes them well suited for applications like building insulation.\\n\\nOne way in which geopolymers could be applied is as a replacement for the Portland cement in concrete. Portland cement has several drawbacks- it needs to be heated up before use, it emits carbon dioxide when it sets, and it contains portlandite which can cause corrosion in steel structures. Geopolymer concrete would eliminate these problems because the geopolymer mixture sets at room temperature and does not contain portlandite. It also has the potential to last longer than traditional concrete because of its resistance to corrosion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Applications of geopolymers\\\" \\nGeopolymers are a type of composite material that is made from geopolymerizing an alkaline solution with a source of calcium and an alkaline earth metal.
