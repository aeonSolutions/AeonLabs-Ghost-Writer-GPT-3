### 0.1 - Extract Zip file contents
- Create a new directory named "Jupyter" inside the directory c:\users\\%userName%
- Create a new directory named "GPT3" inside the directory c:\users\\%userName%\Jupyter

where %userName% is your windows account username

Extract Zip files contents a to the Directory c:\users\\%userName%\\Jupyter\GPT3

In the end, should be look like this

### 5 - Open a Jupyer Notebook
In the Tab with the jupyter notebooks files and folders click to open the "Jupyter" folder (created earlier). Next click to open the "GPT3" folder (created earlier).

The last step is to open the jupyter notebook "*OpenAI Essay Writer.ipynb*". Double click an a new tab will open in the browser.
